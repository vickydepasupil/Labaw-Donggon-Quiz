# LabawDonggonQuiz

A two-page Information and Quiz project, submitted as final requirement for the first quarter of the UP ITDC full time program. Used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap.

The Quiz Page asks 10 questions based on the story of Labaw Donggon told in the Home Page. The user has the option to keep retaking the quiz again and again, and the results are presented as follows:

At the time of creation, I only knew how to write JavaScript and jQuery internally, so the lenghty set of JavaScript and jQuery functions are located inside the MP_QuizPage.html file.
