# LabawDonggonQuiz
Final project for the first quarter of the UP ITDC full time program. Used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap.
At the time of creation, I only knew how to write JavaScript and jQuery internally, so the lenghty set of JavaScript and jQuery functions can be found inside the MP_QuizPage.html file.

Photos used in the project are mostly from The Aswang Project, an online resource for Philippine mythology, legends and folktales.

Saragnayan's photo is from Philippine Pre-Colonial Myths Blogspot site.
