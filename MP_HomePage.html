<h3 class="storyTitle">A Short Background</h3>
<p class="storyInfo">The story of Labaw Donggon comes from the Hinilawod, the oldest epic poem that originates from Panay and one of the longest epics in the world.<br><br>

Generally translated as "The Tales from the Mouth of the Halawod River", the Hinilawod is composed of two parts chronicling the life and adventures of Labaw Donggon and Humadapnon, sons of the goddess Alunsina with the mortal, Datu Paubari. The first part is composed of 2,325 lines dedicated to telling the story of Labaw Donggon. The second part is composed of 53,000 lines, telling the story of his brothers Humadapnon and Dumalapdap.</p>

<h3 class="storyTitle">Hinilawod</h3>
<p class="storyInfo">The story begins when Alunsina, the goddess of the Eastern Sky, reaches maidenhood. Her father Kaptan, chief of all the gods, decreed that his daughter was to be married. All unmarried gods of the universe wooed Alunsina, but none succeeded in winning her affections. From among her suitors, she fell in love and chose to marry the ruler of Halawod, the mortal Datu Paubari.<br><br>

Offended and angered by Alunsina's decision, her other suitors plotted revenge on the newlyweds. Maklium-sa-t’wan, god of the plains, called for a meeting where it was decided that Halawod was to be destoyed by flood. Suklang Malayon, the goddess of Happy Homes and sister of Alunsina, came to learn of the evil plot and warned the couple. Alunsina and Paubari took refuge on higher ground, and were able to escape harm.<br><br>

Several months later Alunsina became pregnant and gave birth to triplets. She named them Labaw Donggon, Humadapnon and Dumalapdap. A cold wind from the north came and the three infants were suddenly transformed into strong, handsome young men.

<h3 class="storyTitle">Labaw Donggon</h3>
<p class="storyInfo">Labaw Donggon, the eldest of the three, asked his mother to prepare his magic cape, hat, belt and kampilan (sword), for he heard of a place called Handug. There, a beautiful maiden by the name of Angoy Ginbitinan, lived.<br><br>

The journey took several days. He walked across plains and valleys, climbed up mountains until he reached the mouth of the Halawod river. When he finally met the maiden’s father and asked for her hand in marriage, he was tasked to fight the monster Manalintad as part of his dowry. Labaw Donggon went off to confront the monster, and with the help of his magic belt, he killed Manalintad. To prove his feat, he brought the monster’s tail to Angoy Ginbitinan’s father.<br><br>

After the wedding, Labaw Donggon proceeded home with his new bride. Along the way, they met a group of young men who were heading to Tarambang Burok to win the hand of Abyang Durunuun. Abyang Durunuun was the sister of Sumpoy, the lord of the underworld. Her beauty was legendary, and attracted suitors far and wide.<br><br>

Labaw Donggon and his bride continued on their journey home. The moment they arrived, Labaw Donggon told his mother to take care of his wife, because he was to embark on another quest. He was going to Tarambang Burok to win the hand of Abyang Durunuun.<br><br>

Before he could get to Tarambang Burok, he has to pass a ridge guarded by a giant with a hundred arms. The giant's name was Sikay Padalogdog, and he would not allow Labaw Donggon to go through without a fight. However, Sikay Padalogdog was no match to Labaw Donggon’s prowess and skill in fighting, so he gave up and allowed him to continue.<br><br>

Labaw Donggon won the hand of Abyang Durunuun and also took her home. Before long he went on another journey, this time it was to Gadlum to ask for the hand of Malitong Yawa Sinagmaling Diwata. She was the young bride of Saragnayan, the lord of darkness.<br><br>

This trip required him to use his biday nga inagta (black boat), on which he sailed across the seas for many months. He went across the region of the clouds, and passed the land of stones, until he finally reached the shores of Tulogmatian, the seaside fortress of Saragnayan. The moment he set foot on the ground Saragnayan asked him, “Who are you and why are you here?”<br><br></p>

<img id="Saragnayan" src="Images/Saragnayan.jpg" alt="Saragnayan">
<p class="storyInfo"> To which he answered, “I am Labaw Donggon, son of Datu Paubari and goddess Alunsina of Halawod. I came for the beautiful Malitong Yawa Sinagmaling Diwata.”<br><br>

Saragnayan laughed. He told Labaw Donggon that what he wished for was impossible to grant, because she was his wife. Labaw Donggon then challenged Saragnayan to a duel saying that whoever wins will have her.<br><br>

The challenge was accepted and the duel ensued. Labaw Donggon submerged Saragnayan under water for seven years, but when he let go, Saragnayan was still alive. The latter uprooted a coconut tree and started beating Labaw Donggon with it. He survived the beating but was not able to surpass the powers of Saragnayan’s pamlang (amulet), and was eventually imprisoned by Saragnayan beneath his house.<br><br>

Back home Angoy Ginbitinan and Abyang Durunuun both delivered sons. Angoy Ginbitinan’s child was named Aso Mangga and Abyang Durunuun’s son was called Abyang Baranugon.<br><br>

Only a few days after they were born, Aso Mangga and Abyang Baranugon embarked to look for their father. They rode their sailboats through the region of eternal darkness, passed the region of the clouds and the land of stones, finally reaching Saragnayan’s home. Saragnayan noticed that Abyang Baranugon’s umbilical cord have not yet been removed, he laughed and told the child to go home to his mother.<br><br>

Abyang Baranugon was slighted by the remarks and immediately challenged Saragnayan to a duel. They fought and Abyang Baranugon defeated Saragnayan. It was in this way that he won his father’s freedom.</p>
